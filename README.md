# üè† Home SOC Lab: Threat Detection with Azure Sentinel

This project simulates a home-based Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Azure services. It focuses on cloud-based threat detection, log analysis, and global attacker tracking using a public-facing virtual machine (VM), Log Analytics Workspace, and Microsoft Sentinel.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- Set up a virtual network and subnet in Azure
- Deployed a public virtual machine (Windows Server)
- Configured the VM to forward security logs to **Log Analytics Workspace**
- Integrated **Azure Sentinel** with the workspace for incident detection
- Created **watchlists** to track failed logon attempts and attacker IPs
- Used IP data from logs to map attacker locations globally

## üîß Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Azure
- Virtual Network & Subnet
- Virtual Machine (Windows)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Watchlists
- IP Geolocation
